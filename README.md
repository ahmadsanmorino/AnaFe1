# AnaFe: A template for features selection and machine learning-based analysis

This template is useful for studies related to feature selection, classification, and machine learning-base analysis

## Description

There are three feature selection mechanisms available:
1. Extra Tree Classifier (To get Information Gain from each feature)
2. Chi-Square (To measure how strong the relationship between features)
3. Correlation Coefficient (To shows the correlation between features)
You can use one of them, or combine the three mechanisms to get the best selection results

We provide four ready-to-use machine-learning classifiers to be analyzed:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Random Forest
3. Multilayer Perceptron
4. Logistic Regression

There are several options for machine learning-based analysis:
1. Confusion-matrix table
2. Accuracy
3. Precision
4. Sensitivity
5. f1-score
6. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
The analysis's results are presented in tables and graphs for easy comprehension.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To start trying this template, you'll need to prepare a few things on your computer:
* Anaconda Individual Edition [See Windows(64bit](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/hashes/Anaconda3-2021.05-Windows-x86_64.exe-hash/), [MacOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/), and [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)).
* Python3

## System requirements

* Operating system: Windows 8 or newer, 64-bit macOS 10.13+, or Linux, including Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS 7+, and others.
* If your operating system is older than what is currently supported, you can find older versions of the Anaconda installers in our archive that might work for you. 
* System architecture: Windows- 64-bit x86, 32-bit x86; MacOS- 64-bit x86; Linux- 64-bit x86, 64-bit aarch64 (AWS Graviton2 / arm64), 64-bit Power8/Power9, s390x (Linux on IBM Z & LinuxONE).
* Minimum 5 GB disk space to download and install.

### Installing

Just download the code and dataset from https://github.com/ahmadsanmorino/AnaFe1, and run it on Anaconda Prompt or Jupyter Notebook.
