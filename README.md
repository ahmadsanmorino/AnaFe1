# TripleFe: The robust combination for features selection and machine learning-based analysis

This template is useful for studies related to feature selection, classification, and machine learning-base analysis

## Description

There are three combined feature selection mechanisms:
* Extra Tree Classifier (To get Information Gain from each feature)
* Chi-Square (To measure how strong the relationship between features)
* Correlation Coefficient (To shows the correlation between features)

You can use one of them, but I suggest combining the three mechanisms is the right choise to get the best results 

We also provide ready-to-use machine-learning classifiers to be analyzed:
* Support Vector Machine
* Random Forest
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Logistic Regression

There are several options for machine learning-based analysis:
* Confusion-matrix table
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Sensitivity
* f1-score
* Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.

The analysis's results are presented in tables and graphs for easy comprehension.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To start trying this template, you'll need to prepare a few things on your computer:
* Anaconda Individual Edition [See Windows 64bit](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/hashes/Anaconda3-2021.05-Windows-x86_64.exe-hash/), [MacOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/), and [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/).
* Python3

## System requirements

* Operating system: Windows 8 or newer, 64-bit macOS 10.13+, or Linux, including Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS 7+, and others.
* If your operating system is older than what is currently supported, you can find older versions of the Anaconda installers in our archive that might work for you. 
* System architecture: Windows- 64-bit x86, 32-bit x86; MacOS- 64-bit x86; Linux- 64-bit x86, 64-bit aarch64 (AWS Graviton2 / arm64), 64-bit Power8/Power9, s390x (Linux on IBM Z & LinuxONE).
* Minimum 5 GB disk space to download and install.

### Installing

Just download the code and dataset from https://github.com/ahmadsanmorino/AnaFe1, and run it on Anaconda Prompt or Jupyter Notebook.
